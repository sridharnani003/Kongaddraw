[display]
; Run in windowed mode instead of fullscreen emulation
; Set to true if you want to play in a window
windowed=false

; Maintain aspect ratio when scaling (adds black bars if needed)
; Set to false to stretch to fill the entire window
maintas=true

; Enable vertical sync to prevent screen tearing
; May introduce input lag on some systems
vsync=true

; Use non-exclusive fullscreen (borderless windowed)
; Only applies when windowed=false
nonexclusive=false

; Window position (-1 = centered on screen)
; Only applies when windowed=true
posX=-1
posY=-1

; Custom window size (0 = use game's resolution)
; Only applies when windowed=true
width=0
height=0

[scaling]
; Scaling mode:
;   stretch  - Stretch to fill window (may distort aspect ratio)
;   integer  - Scale by integer multiples only (pixel-perfect)
;   aspect   - Scale maintaining aspect ratio (black bars)
mode=aspect

; Use bilinear filtering when scaling (smoother but blurry)
; Set to false for sharp nearest-neighbor scaling
filter=true

[rendering]
; Maximum frames per second (0 = unlimited)
; Useful for reducing CPU usage or fixing game speed issues
maxfps=0

[mouse]
; Adjust mouse coordinates for scaled/windowed mode
; Required for games to receive correct mouse positions
adjmouse=true

; Lock mouse cursor to the game window
; Useful for games that don't clip the cursor themselves
lockcursor=false

[compatibility]
; Don't send WM_ACTIVATEAPP messages to the game
; May help with games that pause when losing focus
noactivateapp=false

; Limit game to single CPU core
; Fixes timing issues in some older games
singlecpu=false

; Fix surface pitch alignment to 4-byte boundaries
; Required for most games, disable only if it causes issues
fixpitch=true

[debug]
; Enable debug output (visible in DebugView or debugger)
enabled=false

; Write debug log to file (leave empty to disable)
